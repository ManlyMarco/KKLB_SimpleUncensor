# KKLB_SimpleUncensor
A simple Uncensor for the game KoiKoi Love Blossoms (恋来い温泉物語) by Apricot Heart. It removes the heart censors, replaces female body texture with a custom one, and changes the meat stick color to match the rest of the male body.

You can buy the game [on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840350/KoiKoi_VR_Love_Blossoms/) or [on DLsite](https://www.dlsite.com/pro/work/=/product_id/VJ01000460.html). The purchase contains both VR and non-VR versions (non-VR version is available as free DLC on Steam).

If the game is in Japanese, make sure you have the latest version and go to Settings (button with a cog icon in main menu) and select English in the dropdown setting at the bottom of the list.

## Download
Check the [releases](/../../releases) (only dll, no texture).

## How to use
1. Apply latest [64bit version of BepInEx v5.x](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) to the game.
2. Copy the plugin .dll to your BepInEx\plugins folder inside the game directory.
3. You also need to provide a replacement body texture. It should be in the same directory as the plugin dll and be named `KKLB_SimpleUncensor_Texture.png`.
